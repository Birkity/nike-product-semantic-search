    "## Building the Search Engine for E-commerce Product Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook focuses on constructing a semantic search engine for e-commerce product recommendations, specifically for Nike products. I used product names, subtitles, and descriptions to provide a more comprehensive search experience. The steps include preprocessing, embedding computation, similarity calculation, ranking, knowledge graph integration, query expansion, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocess the Dataset**: Utilize name, subtitle, and description for embedding computation.\n",
    "2. **Compute Embeddings**: Use SBERT to generate embeddings for a concatenated string of name, subtitle, and description.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**: Compare the embeddings to find relevant products.\n",
    "4. **Rank Products**: Sort results based on similarity scores.\n",
    "5. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: simulate a knowledge graph for smaller datasets or prototyping.\n",
    "6. **Query Expansion**: Allow users to expand their search terms.\n",
    "7. **Optimization**: Implement caching for embeddings to improve speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why SBERT?\n",
    "SBERT is chosen for its ability to produce dense vector representations that capture semantic similarity across different text fields, which is beneficial for our multi-field approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why NetworkX for Knowledge Graph?\n",
    "NetworkX provides a simple way to simulate a knowledge graph for smaller datasets or prototyping. It allows us to represent relationships between products based on attributes like color, which can enrich our search capabilities.\n",
